Participants recruited via Mechanical Turk completed a power priming manipulation in which they were asked recall and visualize a time when they were high or low in power. After writing a description of their visualization, they completed a series of tasks to assess three dependent variables.\n\nParticipants'  **action/inaction intentions** were measured with 7 questions (e.g., \"I am feeling energetic\"; 1 = *not at all*, 7 = *extremely*; Albarracin, 2009, unpublished). \n\nParticipants' **trust** was measured with two measures. Six items from the World Values Survey asked how much participants trust people belonging to different groups (e.g., \"People you meet for the first time\"; 1 = *trust completely*, 4 = *do not trust at all*). Participants also completed the trust game (Berg et al., 1995), which asked them how many raffle tickets they would entrust to another person who may or may not return them.\n\nTwo measures assessed participants' **perspective taking**. Participants answered seven items from the perspective-taking subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1980). These items were slightly modified to assess state rather than trait perspective taking motivation (e.g., \"Before criticizing somebody, I'd try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place\"; 1 = *does not describe me at all*, 5 = *describes me very well*). Participants also completed 10 items from the Adult Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test-Revised (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste & Plumb, 2001), which asked them to look at images of people's eyes and choose which of four emotions was expressed.\n\nParticipants completed measures for each of the dependent variables in a random order. For trust and perspective-taking, the two measures were also randomly ordered.\n\n## Load the raw data\n\nThe data were collected using Qualtrics. The first row of the raw data file contains most of the variable names. The second row contains some further variable names and the question wording. Rows three and beyond contain participant data. So we will first load in the two sets of variable names and combine them. Then, we will load in the data.\n\n```{r, cache=FALSE}\nfilename <- \"PR__Priming_Power__3_DVs__Action_PerspectiveTaking_Distrust.csv\"\n\nname1 <- names(read.csv(filename, nrow = 1))\nname2 <- names(read.csv(filename, nrow = 1, skip = 1))\nnames <- c(name2[1:22], name1[23:(length(name1))])\nraw <- read.csv(filename, header = FALSE, skip = 2, col.names = names,\n                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\n```\n\n## Reduce data set to a final, usable set of cases\n\nThe final data set should only contain cases that represent:\n\n+ US participants\n+ Participants who passed the instructional manipulation check (IMC)\n\nWe will identify and count cases that do not meet these criteria. \n\n```{r}\n# how many cases total?\ntotalCases <- nrow(raw)\n\n# identify surveys from outside the US\nnonUScount <- nrow(raw[with(raw, Country != \"United States\"),])\n\n# identify participants who failed the IMC\nfailedIMCcount <- nrow(raw[with(raw, IMC != 10),])\n\n# identify participants who meet both exclusion criteria\nbothExcludeCount <- nrow(raw[with(raw, IMC != 10 & Country != \"United States\"),])\n\n# create final data set and count cases\nfinal <- raw[with(raw, IMC == 10 & Country == \"United States\"),]\nfinalCases <- nrow(final)\n```\n\nFrom `r totalCases` raw cases, `r nonUScount` had non-US IP addresses and `r failedIMCcount` failed the IMC (`r bothExcludeCount` failed the IMC *and* had a non-US IP), leavinb `r finalCases` for analysis.\n\n### Final data set\n\nFinally, we will create a reduced data set that includes only valid cases that are not excluded for any of the reasons above. \n\n```{r}\nfinal <- raw[with(raw, US == TRUE & IPDuplicate == FALSE & Status == 0\n                  & Finished == 1 & numNAs < 8),]\n```\n\nThis final data set contains `r nrow(final)` cases.\n\n\n\n",

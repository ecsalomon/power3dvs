I also realized that if I were left behind to be in charge I didn't really want him with me. His attitude would just make it harder on everyone so I told him that I would speak with the Maintenance Officer and see if I couldn't get him sent home with the Squadron.

Some days it doesn't feel like it but if I keep those things in mind I can keep trying to do better.",I'm a caring person and I want others to do good. So I answered my questions how I feel.,The ladder can represent a lot of things. I'm not worthless just because I'm not financially stable.  Some people have treated me that way which hurts. I guess I should have put myself at the bottom rung because I'm broke but I have a good heart and would help everyone I could and I have in the past done lots for others. So I didn't put myself on the bottom rung because money doesn't make a good person.  It sure helps pay the bills for sure. Society thinks if you are rich you are everything and treat you like that too. Some rich people are so rude and hurtful and wasteful. I'm sure they are lonely too with no real friends. ,1,1,,,,,26.621704101562,-81.840599060059,-1,

I had to evaluate how well the cast and crew did, by checking to make sure actors did their lines right or blocking and calling cues for the crew. An specific example is once I was giving notes back to the cast after a rehearsal and calling out the mistakes they made. A few actors were talking in the background and generally not paying attention, so I had to call them out on it. It felt rather nerve-wracking because I did not know if they would response well to me.  But afterwards it was kind of a powerful feeling because I was able to exert my position of authority of them and make sure they know I would not tolerate them goofing around during notes.

I pushed him back to get him away from me, and he said, ""Oh you want to fight like the man in the relationship?"" and got up and put me in a headlock. And he said that he would show me what happens when I try to act like the man. He then uppercut my nose with all of his force and blood went everywhere. The bed, the floor, my dresser, the wall. Everywhere. I started screaming and I just started running. It was the middle of winter, I had no shoes or jacket on, but I knew I just needed to run. I made it to the community laundry room, blood soaked, and I locked myself inside the bathroom they had in it. I was so terrified that he was looking for me, so I told myself I had to quit crying or he would hear me and find me. I started grabbing paper towels and just watched the blood pour out onto them. A thought crossed through my head that the blood would never stop coming, and I would eventually die. All of a sudden, I heard a couple of people come into the laundry room, and I froze. I didn't want anyone to see me in that situation. I felt like nothing. Like a maggot. And I had never felt so powerless, stuck in that bathroom. He was in my home, a home that I pay for, and I'm the one who asked him to live with me. I put myself in that situation, and yet with all of those choices that I had made, I had no control. I sat on that cold bathroom floor for around an hour until it was so cold that I couldn't feel my feet anymore. So I made the walk back home. We had a very small apartment, so as soon as you open the door you see directly into the bedroom. As I entered the apartment, I saw him sitting up in bed, glaring at me. I still had tears running down my face, but it was silent. He just stared as I came into the room, and he said NOTHING. Not a single sound. Not an apology, or anything. Normally when he would hurt me, he would apologize profusely, which would be why I stayed with him ,because I really thought he was sorry. But in this moment, I saw the person he truly was. A twisted, demented soul, and I had never been more scared in my life. Who was this monster I was sharing my life with? How can he appear so normal to everyone else, but really be this person inside? And yet, I stayed with him still. He had me believing that nobody else on the planet would want me. And so I stayed. I stayed for about a month more.

We had a scheduled meeting with the gentleman a week after we inquired about it. There was a lot of feelings of anxiety leading up to our appointment. /  / We discussed our financial situation, wages, job positions, hours worked, other property we may own, any savings or retirement plans.  He evaluated us based on our total income and deducted our expenses to figure out what our disposable income was. My wife and I were very stressed at this point due to the man having all the power to control whether we are able to start building a home for our family or to continue to struggle with a temporary residence. /  / After he took everything into consideration, he opted to not provide us with the loan due to having a short, limited credit history. The feeling of disappointment was enormous at this point. I felt ashamed that regardless of the hard work we put forth, it wasn't enough. We had both been very upset over the outcome of the meeting but we had decided to do what we had been doing all along, work hard, so that eventually we would receive a home loan decision in our favor.",4.952,464.819,614.135,4,1,23,23,20,23,20,23,20,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,500,1,1,20,22,22,22,23,22,22,1,20,20,22,20,19,20,21,19,22,19,1,7,10,1,1,27,United States,Agnostic,3,,4,2,3,,1,A study on how people feel about themselves objectively.,No,It is interesting to be asked to write about a vulnerable situation I was in.
